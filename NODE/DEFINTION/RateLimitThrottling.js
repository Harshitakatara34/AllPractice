// rate limiting restricts the number of requests a client can make over time, while 
// throttling controls the speed at which server resources are used to process those requests. 
// Both mechanisms help maintain a balanced and controlled use of resources.










// REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE

// Rate Limiting: Imagine a public transportation system like a bus service. 
// The rate limiting in this case restricts the number of passengers who can board 
// a bus within a certain time frame. For instance, only 30 passengers are allowed to 
// board the bus every 15 minutes. This ensures that the bus doesn't get overcrowded, 
// maintains order, and serves passengers fairly.

// Throttling: Now, consider a water faucet or tap. Throttling is like adjusting the 
// flow rate of water from the tap. Even though you can use the tap continuously, you 
// have control over how fast the water flows. You can turn it to a trickle, a steady 
// stream, or full flow. Throttling helps in managing the speed at which water 
// (or data in the case of web requests) is released, preventing wastage or flooding.
