// WebSocket is a protocol for real-time, two-way communication between clients and servers, 
// ideal for instant updates in web applications, and it's implemented in Node.js with libraries like socket.io.

// Example===>Real time Chat Application'











// Online Chat Applications:
// WebSocket is commonly used in online chat applications to enable real-time messaging between users. 
// When you send a message in a chat app, it's instantly delivered to the recipient(s) without needing 
// to refresh the page or repeatedly poll the server.

// Imagine you're using a messaging app like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or Slack. When you send a message, 
// it appears on the recipient's screen almost immediately, and their replies are instantly visible to you. 
// This real-time messaging experience is made possible by WebSocket technology, allowing for seamless and 
// immediate communication between users and the server.
