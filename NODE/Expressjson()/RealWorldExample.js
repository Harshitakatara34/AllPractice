// The Server: Imagine you're running a restaurant, and you have a chef in the kitchen. 
//             The chef is like a server in a computer program, waiting for customers to place orders.




// Customer Orders: Customers come into your restaurant and give their orders. 
//                 In the digital world, clients (like web browsers or mobile apps) send 
//                 requests to your server with information, such as what they want to do.




// Understanding Orders: Just like your chef needs to understand what customers want to 
//                      cook their meals, your server needs to understand what clients want to do with 
//                      your program. In the digital world, this understanding is often in the form of data, 
//                      and it's common for clients to send data in JSON format because it's easy for both humans
//                       and computers to read.



// Parsing JSON Data: Here's where app.use(express.json()) comes in. It's like having a helper who can quickly 
//                     read the customer's order and translate it for the chef. In your server code, when you use app.use(express.json()),
//                    you're telling your server to have this helper ready. When a client sends JSON data, this helper reads and translates
//                it into a format your server can work with.



// Processing Orders: With the orders (or data) now translated into a format your server understands, 
//                   you can process them. For example, if a customer orders a pizza with specific toppings, 
//                   your chef knows how to make that pizza. Similarly, in your server code, you can now work 
//                 with the JSON data to perform actions or provide responses based on what the client requested.




// So, in easy words, app.use(express.json()) is like having a translator in your restaurant who can understand 
// customer orders written in a foreign language (JSON) and convert them into something your chef (server) can work with. 
// This allows your server to handle client requests that involve sending data in JSON format
