// In short, the event loop is a fundamental concept in both JavaScript (browser) and Node.js,
//  but their implementations and use cases differ. In the browser, it manages user interactions 
//  and web-related events, while in Node.js, it handles I/O operations and custom events in a server-side environment, 
//  offering scalability and non-blocking capabilities. give examples of it 






// Javascript==addEventListener

// These examples illustrate how the event loop is utilized differently in JavaScript (browser) and Node.js 
// to manage various asynchronous tasks and events in their respective environments.
