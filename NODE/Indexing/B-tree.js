// B-tree is like a fancy phonebook for data.


// Imagine you have a massive phonebook with names (data) of people. 
// You want to find a specific name quickly, like "Alice." Here's how a B-tree helps:

// Balanced and Sorted: The phonebook is neatly organized so that it's easy to flip through. 
// The names are in alphabetical order, so you can quickly jump to the right section.

// Easy to Find: Instead of flipping through every page, you look at the first page. 
// It tells you which section of the phonebook to check next. You keep narrowing down until you find "Alice."

// Efficient: Because the phonebook is sorted and has these guide pages, 
// you can find names much faster than flipping through every page one by one.

// No Wasted Time: You don't waste time looking in sections that you know don't have the name you're seeking. 
// It's like a secret code that tells you exactly where to look.

// So, a B-tree is like a super-smart, well-organized phonebook for data. 
// It helps computers quickly find what they're looking for, even in a massive sea of information.
