// Hash the Password: Using bcrypt, you hash the plain-text password and the salt together. 
//                    The bcrypt hash function takes the password, salt, and a cost factor as input.
//                     The cost factor (e.g., 10) determines the number of rounds the hashing algorithm
//                      will run to make it computationally expensive for attackers to crack the hash.
