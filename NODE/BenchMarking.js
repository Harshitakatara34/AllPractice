// Benchmarking is like comparing how fast or well something works compared to a known standard or other similar things.
//  It helps us figure out if something is doing a good job or not.



// To benchmark a specific function in Node.js, you can encapsulate that function within the console.time() 
// and console.timeEnd() blocks

// Define the function you want to benchmark
// function timeConsumingOperation() {
//     for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
//       // Some time-consuming operation
//     }
//   }
//   // Start the timer
//   console.time("myOperation");
//   // Call the function you want to benchmark
//   timeConsumingOperation();
//   // Stop the timer
//   console.timeEnd("myOperation");
  






// USES
// 1.Measure Performance
// 2.Identify Performance Issues
// 3.Compare Implementations
// 4.Set Performance Goals
// 5.Optimize for Efficiency






// For example, if you have two cars and you want to know which one is faster, 
// you can race them against each other. The car that finishes first is the benchmark,
//  and you can see how the other car compares to it. This way, you can decide which car
//   is better in terms of speed. 
  
  
//   That's similar to how benchmarking works for systems and processes,
//    where you compare their performance to a known standard or other systems 
//    to see how well they are doing.
