// Micro Task: Micro tasks are high-priority, asynchronous tasks that are executed after the current JavaScript execution context, often associated with promise callbacks and async/await.

// Microtasks, including promise callbacks (then, catch, finally) and other microtask sources like async/await, mutation observers, and queueMicrotask, are executed first. These are higher-priority tasks and run before macrotasks.
