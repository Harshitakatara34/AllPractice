// macro tasks are like big tasks (cleaning the kitchen), and micro tasks are like small, 
// immediate actions (drying a plate) within those big tasks. JavaScript uses this concept 
// to manage the order of execution, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations 
// like timers or promises.
