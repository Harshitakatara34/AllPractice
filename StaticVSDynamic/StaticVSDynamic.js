// Static Language (e.g., Java): Types are declared before runtime, catching errors early, 
//                               which makes code more reliable but can be slower to develop.

// Dynamic Language (e.g., Python,Javascript): Types are determined at runtime, allowing for faster development but potentially 
//                                  leading to runtime errors.
