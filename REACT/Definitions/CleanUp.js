// The cleanup function in useEffect is used to handle tasks like unsubscribing 
// from event listeners, clearing timers, or cleaning up resources when a React 
// component unmounts or when specific dependencies change. It's important to 
// prevent memory leaks and ensure that no lingering effects interfere with the 
// component's behavior or cause unexpected issues.
