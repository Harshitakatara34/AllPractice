// Keys in React are unique identifiers for elements in lists. They improve performance by helping React update, 
// reorder, and render list elements efficiently.

// (To avoid re-render)

// Example==>
let list=['a','b','c'];
// by key we can identify which element is edited,updated,deleted etc.(it should be unique)

// If we will not give different keys to these elements then they will be re-rendered again and again .
