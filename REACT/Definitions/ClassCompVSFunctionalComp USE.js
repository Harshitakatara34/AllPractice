// Functional Components:
// Use for simplicity, reusability, and performance.
// Ideal for managing state with hooks, using the Context API, and server-side rendering.




// Class Components:
// Use for complex state management, lifecycle methods, or when working with legacy code.
// Suitable for ref forwarding, Higher Order Components (HOCs), and inheritance, but consider functional 
// components and hooks for new projects.
