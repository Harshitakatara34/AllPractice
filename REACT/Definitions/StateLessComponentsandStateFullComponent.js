// stateless components are simpler and only deal with props and rendering, 
// while stateful components manage their own internal state and are more complex. 
// React has shifted toward functional components and hooks for most use cases due to 
// their simplicity and flexibility.




// StateLess====>Functional Component(Pure Component)
// StateFull===>Class Component(Impure Component)
