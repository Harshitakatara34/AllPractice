// useEffect (Handles sideEffects): Imagine it as something you want to do after something happens. 
//                                  For example, you want to show a message every time the page loads.

// useMemo: Think of it like a memory. If you have a complex calculation that takes a long time, 
//                                     you can use useMemo to remember the result so that you 
//                                     don't have to calculate it every time.
