// Both React.Fragment and <> </> serve the same purpose, which is to create fragments in React for grouping elements without adding an extra DOM element. The key difference is in the syntax:


// `<React.Fragment>` is an explicit way to create a fragment in React and allows you to add keys and attributes. `<>` and `</>` are shorthand syntax for creating fragments without keys or attributes.
