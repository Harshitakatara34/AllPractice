<!-- What Is Reference Error??
Whenever compiler accessing the variable which is in the memory and we can't access it then it will give reference error 
like in let . -->


<!-- 
 Hoisting in Case of LET & Const 
 In let and const the variable will remain in script memory by assigning undefined to it not in global memory till then it is not 
 initialised with value and that zone we also known as temporal dead Zone . -->


 <!-- For Debugginf in console we have to write debugger in code from where we have to debuf the code and then check in scope -->
 <!-- there is a gloal scope where we can check the process  -->









<!-- // What is Temporal Dead Zone  -->
<!-- The time between since the variabe is hoisted and the till  when it is initialised  the time between them is TDZ -->

<!-- And When it get initialised with some value it will move out of TDZ -->
<!-- Whenever the variable is in TDZ we can't access them    that's why it gives reference Error  -->

<!-- In var the value is store in global object in sources In sources there will be two things one is global and other is script 
let and const value will stored in script not in global . -->
