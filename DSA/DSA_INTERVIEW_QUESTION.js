// Certainly! Here are some code-based interview questions in JavaScript:

// 1. **Find the Largest Number:** Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the largest number in the array.

// 2. **Palindrome Check:** Create a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward).

// 3. **Remove Duplicates:** Write a function that removes duplicate values from an array and returns a new array with unique values.

// 4. **Anagram Check:** Implement a function that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in a different order).

// 5. **Factorial Calculation:** Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer.

// 6. **Reverse a String:** Create a function that reverses a string without using the built-in `reverse()` method.

// 7. **FizzBuzz:** Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz"; for multiples of 5, print "Buzz"; and for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."

// 8. **Find Missing Number:** Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, write a function to find the missing number.

// 9. **Binary Search:** Implement a binary search algorithm to find a target value in a sorted array.

// 10. **Linked List Operations:** Create a JavaScript class for a singly linked list with methods to insert, delete, and search for elements.

// 11. **Count Characters in a String:** Write a function that takes a string and returns an object where each key is a character, and the value is the number of times that character appears in the string.

// 12. **Merge Sorted Arrays:** Implement a function that merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

// These code-based questions cover a range of programming challenges and require candidates to demonstrate their problem-solving skills and proficiency in JavaScript. You can adjust the complexity of the questions based on the level of the candidate you are interviewing.
