// // JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that employs objects to represent 
// // real-world entities, promoting code organization and reusability through 
// // constructor functions, classes (ES6), and prototype-based inheritance.







// Certainly, here are the key concepts related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript explained in a simple and concise way:

// Objects: Think of objects as containers that hold information and actions, like describing a car with its color and the ability to drive.

// Constructor Functions: They are like templates for creating objects with similar features, such as creating multiple cars with the same properties and abilities.

// Classes (ES6): A newer way to define templates for objects, making it easier to create and manage them.

// Inheritance: Objects can inherit features from other objects, like a new car inheriting traits from an existing car.

// Encapsulation: Imagine putting information and actions related to an object in a neat box, making it easy to use while hiding complex details.

// Abstraction: Simplify complex things by breaking them into smaller, understandable parts, like describing a car without needing to know every detail of how it works.

// Polymorphism: Treating different objects as if they were the same type, making code more flexible.

// Prototype-based Inheritance: Objects can share features by having a "family tree" of properties and methods.

// Composition: Combine smaller objects to build more complex ones, like building a car by putting together its parts.

// In simple terms, OOP in JavaScript helps us organize information and actions in a logical and reusable way, like building with Lego blocks to create things.
