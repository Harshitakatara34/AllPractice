// Try and Catch: Used for handling exceptions or errors in code.

// Async and Await: Used for working with asynchronous operations, 
// making asynchronous code more readable and error-handling easier, 
// and allowing sequential logic in asynchronous operations.

// Use async/await instead of .then/.catch for better readability, 
// improved error handling, easier sequential logic, and a more structured codebase.
