// Attack Surface Management:
// Attack Surface Management is like keeping an eye on all the doors and windows of a house to make sure no bad guys can get in. In the digital world, it means checking and managing all the ways hackers could try to attack a computer system or network. For example, if a company has a website, an app, and a server, Attack Surface Management makes sure each of those parts is secure and not an easy target for cyber-attacks.

// Penetration Testing:
// Penetration Testing is like hiring a friendly burglar to test the security of your house. In the digital world, it's about hiring experts to intentionally try to break into a computer system to find weaknesses. The goal is to discover and fix these weaknesses before the real bad guys (hackers) can exploit them. For instance, if a company has a new website, penetration testers might try to find ways to get in and report any vulnerabilities to strengthen the site's security.

// In simple terms, Attack Surface Management is about watching and securing all the ways into a digital space, while Penetration Testing is like hiring experts to play the role of a friendly intruder to find and fix any security issues before the real threats show up.
