// Try and Catch: Used for handling exceptions or errors in code.


// Async and Await: Used for working with asynchronous operations, 
// making asynchronous code more readable and error-handling easier, 
// and allowing sequential logic in asynchronous operations.



// Use async/await instead of .then/.catch for better readability, 
// improved error handling, easier sequential logic, and a more structured codebase.




// try-catch is for synchronous error handling, async-await is for handling asynchronous code in a
//  more synchronous style, .then is for handling successful promise resolutions, and .catch is for 
//  handling promise rejections (errors).
