// JSX enhances UI development by blending HTML-like syntax with JavaScript in React. 
// Babel enables modern JavaScript to work on older browsers, ensuring cross-compatibility.

//==========================

// Babel is like a translator for JavaScript. It takes new, fancy JavaScript code and turns it into a simpler version that older web browsers can understand and run. This way, you can use the latest JavaScript features and still support older browsers.
