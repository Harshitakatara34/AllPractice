// A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed later in response to an event or as part of asynchronous programming.



// callback functions are used to delay the execution 
// of a function until a specific condition is met or an event occurs.





// They are commonly used for asynchronous operations, handling events, and deferring logic to improve performance. 
// Callbacks allow you to control the flow of your code and execute functions at the right time.
