// The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model consists of seven layers that describe how data flows in a network. Here they are in short:

// Physical Layer: Deals with physical connections and transmission of raw binary data over a physical medium (e.g., cables).

// Data Link Layer: Manages data framing, error detection, and addressing within local network segments (e.g., Ethernet).

// Network Layer: Focuses on routing data packets between different networks using logical addressing (e.g., IP).

// Transport Layer: Ensures reliable end-to-end communication, handles flow control, error correction, and data segmentation (e.g., TCP).

// Session Layer: Manages communication sessions, establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections.

// Presentation Layer: Translates data between application and network formats, handling encryption, compression, and character encoding.

// Application Layer: Provides user interfaces and network services for applications (e.g., HTTP for web browsers).

// The OSI model helps standardize network communication by breaking it into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities.
