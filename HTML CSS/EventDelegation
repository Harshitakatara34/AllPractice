Event delegation is a technique where you add a single event listener to a common ancestor of multiple elements you want to monitor. It's efficient for dynamically created elements and reduces the number of event handlers



<ul id="myList">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>




const myList = document.getElementById('myList');

myList.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  if (event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
    console.log(`Clicked on ${event.target.textContent}`);
  }
});



With event delegation, a single event listener on the <ul> element captures click events for all <li> elements within it, simplifying the code.
