<!-- Event delegation is a technique where you add a single event listener to a common ancestor of multiple elements 
you want to monitor. It's efficient for dynamically created elements and reduces the number of event handlers -->

<!-- or  -->

<!-- A technique where you add a single event listener to a parent element on its child elements. -->


<ul id="myList">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

<script>
  const myList = document.getElementById("myList");

  myList.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
      console.log(`Clicked on ${event.target.textContent}`);
    }
  });
</script>

<!-- With event delegation, a single event listener on the
<ul>
  element captures click events for all
  <li>elements within it, simplifying the code.</li>
</ul> -->
